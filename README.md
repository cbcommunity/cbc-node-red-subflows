# VMware Carbon Black Cloud subflows for Node-RED

A collection of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) subflows for integrating with VMware Carbon Black Cloud

## Overview

This is a collection of subflows to help interact with the VMware Carbon Black Cloud APIs.

For more information on these endpoints visit our VMware Carbon Black Cloud [Developer Documentation](https://developer.carbonblack.com/).

To use these subflows, copy the JSON from one of the JSON files in this repo into your Node-RED instance. Do this by going to Node-RED and in the upper right menu, select Import. Paste the JSON for the subflows you want into the Import section and a new Flow will be created with the available subflows.

All subflows require the [VMware Carbon Black Cloud Platform subflows](https://github.com/cbcommunity/cbc-node-red-subflows/blob/master/subflows/cbc-platform-subflows.json) to instantiate the intance.
